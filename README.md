Pixel Playground is a collaborative art experience, inspired by Reddit's Rplace. Users can work with as many friends as they like to create their own masterpiece, one square at a time. Contributors can discuss their work-in-progress over Pixel Chat, and export screenshots of the canvas to our dedicated Imgur gallery for easy sharing.
